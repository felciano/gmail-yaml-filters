    from: (covered.ca.gov OR  donotreplyucsfmychart@ucsf.edu OR  cosmeticdentistryassociates.net OR  hallszeto.com OR  mailer@sparkpeople.com OR  office@mvnutrition.com OR  audrey@notakeout.com OR  cosmeticdentistryassociates.net OR  donotreplyucsfmychart@ucsf.edu OR  rob@pacificanxietygroup.com OR  protonintlondon.com OR  thelondonclinic.co.uk OR  uclh.nhs.uk OR  refer.nhs.uk OR  Maggies.London@maggiescentres.org)

üí° RECOMMENDATIONS:
  ‚Ä¢ Smart labels: These Gmail categories (Social, Promotions, etc.)
    cannot be set via filters. Consider using regular labels instead.

  ‚Ä¢ Filters without actions: Add at least one action like 'label',
    'archive', or 'star' to make these filters functional.

‚úÖ NEXT STEPS:
  1. Review the generated YAML file
  2. Manually add any missing functionality
  3. Test with: gmail-yaml-filters <output_file.yaml>
  4. Consider keeping original XML as backup
